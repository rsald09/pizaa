**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals of this project are the following:
* Using fischertechniks and ROBOPro, build a prototype elevator to go between three floors
* Once the elevator meets the intended floor, a light must turn on indicating the floor
* After a designer-defined period of time, the elevator must go back to the first floor
* Fully comment all functions within the flowchart program

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Physical Construction

#### 1. Design Constraints - All design constraints are met and the prototype goes above and beyond.

My project includes the following elements to meet the design constraints:
* Design was created with Fischertechniks in mind
* Prototype was implemented through Fischertechnik

#### 2. Repeatability of Function - The build is repeatable 100% of the time.

My build includes fischertechnik components to ensure repeatability. For example,...

### ROBOPro Programming Software

#### 1. Design Constraints - All design constraints are met and the prototype goes above and beyond.

My project includes the following elements to meet the design constraints:
* Prototype was programmed through ROBOPro
* Comments communicate the process of the program

Here are some pictures of my code:

#### 2. Repeatability of Function - The build is repeatable 100% of the time.

My build includes certain loops and functions to ensure program repeatability. For example,...

Here is where the code is implemented and integrating with my physical build:
